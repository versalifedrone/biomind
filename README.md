**Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNNs)** are used for the RNA sub-cellular localization (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5210605/).  
QRNNs embrace the benefits of both convolutional and recurrent neural networks alike. QRNNs beat other networks such as LSTM in both accuracy and speed.  

A description of QRNNs can be found in https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.01576. The PyTorch implementation follows https://github.com/salesforce/pytorch-qrnn.
