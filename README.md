# RNA sub-cellular localization with fast-training Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks

This repo contains the code and the report of a final project for the course '**02456 Deep Learning**' held at **DTU** - Technical University of Denmark, Lyngby, by professor Ole Winther.  
*Authors of the project:* Alessandro Montemurro, DTU Compute; Léa Riera, ; Niels, DTU Bioinformatics  
*Supervisors:* Alexander R. Johansen; Josè  
 

**Quasi-Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNNs)** are used for the RNA sub-cellular localization (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5210605/).  
QRNNs embrace the benefits of both convolutional and recurrent neural networks alike. QRNNs beat other networks such as LSTM in both accuracy and speed.
